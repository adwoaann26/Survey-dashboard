# Survey-dashboard

Project Overview
This solo project explores how online learning influences career outcomes. I designed and analyzed a survey targeting adult learners aged 18–40+, focusing on course types, platforms used, motivations, and perceived career impact. The goal: uncover patterns that connect learning choices to real-world results.. 

Key Insights
Top Platforms: Coursera and DataCamp led in usage, especially for Data Analysis and Cyber Security.
Motivations: Career advancement was the #1 driver, followed by job change and personal interest.
Course Duration: Most learners took 1–3 month courses, and those were linked to faster results.
Career Impact: Many reported promotions, new job opportunities, or skill application.
Employer Support: Limited but powerful — those encouraged by employers saw quicker outcomes.

Recommendations
For Learners: Choose focused, short-term courses aligned with your goals. Seek employer support where possible.
For Employers: Encourage upskilling and recognize course completion.
For Educators: Highlight career outcomes and offer modular, flexible learning paths.
